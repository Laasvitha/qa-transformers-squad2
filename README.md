ü§ñ BERT-based Question Answering System (SQuAD v2.0)
This project implements a Question Answering (QA) system powered by BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), fine-tuned on the SQuAD v2.0 dataset. The system can answer questions based on a given context and identify when a question is unanswerable, making it robust and practical for real-world use.

üåü Project Highlights

Dataset: Processes and trains on the SQuAD v2.0 dataset (100,000+ question-answer pairs).
Model: Fine-tunes a pre-trained BERT model for accurate question answering.
Evaluation: Measures performance with F1 score and Exact Match (EM) metrics.
Custom QA: Allows users to input custom contexts and questions for inference.


üéØ Example in Action
Context:  

The Eiffel Tower, a global cultural icon of France, is located in Paris.

Question:  

Where is the Eiffel Tower located?

Answer:  

Paris

Unanswerable Question:  

What is the Eiffel Tower's favorite color?

Answer:  

No answer

üß† How It Works (Beginner-Friendly)

Tokenization: Text is converted into numerical tokens that BERT understands.
Training: The BERT model is fine-tuned on SQuAD v2.0 question-answer pairs.
Prediction: The model identifies the most relevant text span in the context as the answer or flags questions as unanswerable.
Evaluation: Performance is assessed using:
Exact Match (EM): Percentage of answers that match the ground truth exactly.
F1 Score: Measures overlap between predicted and true answers.




üöÄ Getting Started
üñ•Ô∏è Option 1: Run in Google Colab (Recommended for Beginners)

Open QA_BERT_Updated.ipynb in Google Colab.
Download train-v2.0.json and dev-v2.0.json from the SQuAD website and upload them to Colab.
Run all cells in sequence. Ensure you have a GPU runtime enabled for faster training.

üêç Option 2: Run Locally (Advanced Users)

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bert-question-answering-squad2.git
cd bert-question-answering-squad2


Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate


Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt


Download train-v2.0.json and dev-v2.0.json from the SQuAD website.

Launch the notebook:
jupyter notebook QA_BERT_Updated.ipynb




üìã Requirements
The project depends on the following Python libraries:
transformers==4.31.0
datasets==2.14.0
evaluate==0.4.0
torch==2.0.1
scikit-learn==1.3.0
tqdm==4.65.0

Install them with:
pip install transformers==4.31.0 datasets==2.14.0 evaluate==0.4.0 torch==2.0.1 scikit-learn==1.3.0 tqdm==4.65.0

Note: Ensure you have Python 3.8+ and a compatible GPU (if training) for optimal performance.

üìä Evaluating the Model
Evaluate the model's performance on the validation set using the official SQuAD v2.0 evaluation script:
python evaluate-v2.0.py dev-v2.0.json predictions.json

Key Metrics:

exact: Percentage of exact matches between predicted and true answers.
f1: F1 score based on word overlap between predicted and true answers.
HasAns_*: Performance on answerable questions.
NoAns_*: Performance on unanswerable questions.


üîç About SQuAD v2.0
The Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) v2.0 is a benchmark for question answering, featuring:

Over 100,000 answerable questions with text spans from Wikipedia.
Over 50,000 unanswerable questions to test the model's ability to detect when no answer exists.

Learn more at the official SQuAD website.

üîß Enhancements to Explore

Deploy the Model: Create a web interface using Gradio or Streamlit for interactive question answering.
Upgrade the Model: Experiment with larger models like bert-large-uncased or roberta-base for better performance.
Add a UI: Build a user-friendly interface for inputting contexts and questions.
Optimize Performance: Use mixed-precision training or quantization to reduce memory usage and speed up inference.
